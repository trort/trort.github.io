# How to Write Blogs

## 1. Create a New File
Go to the `_posts` directory.
Create a new file with the following naming format:
`YYYY-MM-DD-your-title.md`

Example: `2025-12-30-my-new-post.md`

## 2. Add Front Matter
At the very top of your new file, add the following "front matter" block:

```yaml
---
layout: post
title:  "Your Post Title Here"
date:   2025-12-30 12:00:00 -0500
categories: updates
---
```

## 3. Write Content
Below the second `---`, write your content in Markdown.

## 4. Publish
Commit and push your changes to GitHub.
The site `trort.github.io` will update automatically (it may take a minute or two).
